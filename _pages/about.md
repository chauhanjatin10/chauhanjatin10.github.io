Hi! I am a Computer Science PhD student at UCLA working with Prof [Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/).

Previously, I worked as a researcher at Google AI in the RAiLS team (Robust Algorithms for Learning In Sparse Data Settings) with primary works in spatio-temporal modelling, distribution shifts, fairness and learning from labelled proportions. 

Before that, I finished my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Manohar Kaul](https://www.iith.ac.in/~mkaul/).

My research interests broadly include *Optimization*, *OOD Generalization* and *Deep Learning Theory*. <!-- *Graph Representation Learning*, *Knowledge Graphs*, *Natural Language Processing*, *Topological Analysis of Neural Networks* and *Explainability and Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks*.-->
