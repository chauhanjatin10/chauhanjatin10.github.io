Hi! I am a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google AI, Bangalore working with Aravindan Raghuveer. My ongoing projects are focused on: Imitation Learning, Knowledge Graphs and Graph Contrastive Learning. \
Previously, I finished my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Manohar Kaul](https://www.iith.ac.in/~mkaul/). \
I have worked on several research projects, some of which are published in reputed [Conferences](https://chauhanjatin10.github.io/publications/), while various other works are under progress. I have also served as a reviewer/external-reviewer for these [conferences](https://chauhanjatin10.github.io/service/). My research interests broadly include *Graph Neural Networks*, *Explainability and Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (more specifically, NLP models)*, *Topological Analysis of Neural Networks* and *Knowledge Graphs*.
