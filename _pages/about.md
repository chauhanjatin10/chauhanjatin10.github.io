## Academic 
Hi! I am a Computer Science PhD student at UCLA working with Prof [Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/).
Previously, I worked as a researcher at Google AI in the RAiLS (Robust Algorithms for Learning In Sparse Data Settings) team. My research interests broadly include aspects of Deep Learning Theory, OOD Generalization and Optimization. <!--- with primary works in spatio-temporal modelling, distribution shifts, fairness and learning from labelled proportions. -->

<!-- Before that, I finished my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Manohar Kaul](https://www.iith.ac.in/~mkaul/).
 -->
<!-- My research interests broadly include *Optimization*, *OOD Generalization* and *Deep Learning Theory*. *Graph Representation Learning*, *Knowledge Graphs*, *Natural Language Processing*, *Topological Analysis of Neural Networks* and *Explainability and Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks*.
 -->

## Startups
I am also broadly interested in the startup ecosystem, particularly from the investment viewpoint.<br />
I work (and have worked in the past) with various startups, mainly at UCLA Anderson Business School, on providing them technical advise on the use of AI (machine learning) in their product. Some highlights [here](https://chauhanjatin10.github.io/startups/).
