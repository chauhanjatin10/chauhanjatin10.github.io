Hi! I am a final year undergraduate student in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) and currently working under the supervision of [Dr. Manohar Kaul](https://www.iith.ac.in/~mkaul/). I have more than 2 years of research experience in the field of Machine Learning, during which I have worked on several research projects, some of which are published in reputed [Conferences](https://chauhanjatin10.github.io/publications/), while other works are under progress. I have also served as a reviewer/subreviewer for these [conferences](https://chauhanjatin10.github.io/service/). My research interests broadly include *Explainability and Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (more specifically, NLP models)*, *Topological Analysis of Neural Networks*, *Knowledge Graphs* and *Graph Neural Networks*. I am actively looking for research collaborations and opportunities in the Machine Learning/Deep Learning.
