<!-- ## Academic -->
Hi! I am currently a Research Scientist at [Triomics](https://www.triomics.com/).

I obtained my Masters in Computer Science (specialization in AI) from UCLA (I originally started as a PhD student at UCLA CS, but decided to quit in order to pursue my goals. During that time, I worked with Prof [Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/)).
Before that, I worked as a researcher at Google AI in the RAiLS (Robust Algorithms for Learning In Sparse Data Settings) team. 

My interests span multiple areas of Machine Learning including - LLMs (empirical and theoretical research), distribution shifts, privacy as well as ML applications for Finance. <!---, OOD Generalization and Optimization.  with primary works in spatio-temporal modelling, distribution shifts, fairness and learning from labelled proportions. -->

<!-- Before that, I finished my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Manohar Kaul](https://www.iith.ac.in/~mkaul/).
 -->
<!-- My research interests broadly include *Optimization*, *OOD Generalization* and *Deep Learning Theory*. *Graph Representation Learning*, *Knowledge Graphs*, *Natural Language Processing*, *Topological Analysis of Neural Networks* and *Explainability and Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks*.
 -->

<!-- ## Startups
I am also broadly interested in the startup ecosystem, particularly from the investment viewpoint.<br />
I work (and have worked in the past) with various startups, mainly at UCLA Anderson Business School, on providing them technical advise on the use of AI (machine learning) in their product. Some highlights [here](https://chauhanjatin10.github.io/startups/).  -->
